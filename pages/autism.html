			<h2 class="welcome">10 questions you might want to ask a person suffering with autism.</h2>
			<br>
			<hr>

			<p> A mental illness is a condition that isn't necessarly visible to others. It affects a person's way of thinking, their emotions and thus their behaviour. Here, we have asked a man in his late teens, that we will call A in order to protect his identity, about his disorder: Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism. </p>

			<hr>

			<center> <p> <b> TRIGGER WARNING! Mentions of suicide and self-harm. </b> </p> </center>

			<hr>

			<p> <b> Did you know what autism was before being diagnosed? </b> </p>
						<p> I had a very vague idea about what it was, but I also thought that it meant being stupid. </p>

			<br>

			<p> <b> When were you diagnosed? </b> </p>
						<p> I was about 10 when there were suspicions, but I was properly diagnosed at 11, which is really late. </p>

			<br>

			<p> <b> What were the signs that alerted your parents? </b> </p>
						<p> I was completely obsessed with computers and I amassed a lot of knowledge about it when I was still a child. The fact that I was extremely sensible to sensorial stimuli and the fact that I had difficulties interacting with people were red flags too. </p>

			<br>

			<p> <b> How did you and your parents react to the news? </b> </p>
						<p> My parents said that they were sorry for being really harsh to me about stuff that wasn't my fault. My mother accepted the news really fast but my dad is still in denial, 8 years after the diagnosis.
						As for my reaction... I didn't really understand what it meant at first, but I fell into a deep depression, which can be a side effect of autism, knowing that I wasn't "normal" and that I was condemned from my birth to suffer in a world that wasn't for me. </p>

			<br>

			<p> <b> Did you have any psychological support to get through it? </b> </p>
						<p> It came later than expected and later than I needed it to. I used to see a psychologist that didn't seem to care and only seemed to work for her paycheck at the end of the month. She also used to come to my school to see how things were going there. But as soon as I found another therapist, I knew he was the one. He helped me get over my scars and helped me grow as a person, despite my difficult past and my handicap. I was around 15 when I started getting therapy from him, and I still have appointments with him up to this day. It's almost been 4 years now, and I don't regret choosing him. </p>
			
			<br>

			<p> <b> Is there a therapy to follow? If so, what does it consist of? </b> </p>
						<p> There are multiple possible therapies depending on the patient's condition, but most of the time, it consists on working on social abilities in order to be a functionning member of our society. In general, an autistic person will mostly work on things that may seem surprisingly simple like how to work at school, or even how to work on addictions or depression, because an autistic person is at a higher risk of suffering from those. </p>
			
			<br>

			<p> <b> Can it be cured? </b> </p>
						<p> No, it can't be cured, but you learn how to live with it overtime, sometimes to the point where it can be barely noticeable. This especially applies for high-level autism and aspergers.  </p>

			<br>

			<p> <b> How did you cope with it back then? </b> </p>
						<p> I used to cope with it by isolating myself and playing video games all day long. I felt so bad about being bullied by other people because of my autism that I came to hate it and myself; I cut myself and attempted suicide because of that.
	  </p>

	  		<br>

			<p> <b> How do you deal with it now? </b> </p>
						<p> Now, I mostly use the strengths of my handicap in an excessive manner, like my talent at understanding computers. I learned how to cope with it in healthier ways and got better at interacting with people, which made living with my autism a lot more liveable, but I still suffer from violent outburtsts when things go wrong. </p>

			<br>

			<p> <b> What do you think made you stronger, and what did you learn thanks to your handicap? </b> </p>
						<p> What made me stronger was the fact that I had to adapt to a world that initially didn't make me feel like I fit in it at all. 
						I also learned that the less people know about you, the better. This especially applies in middle and high school. Around that age, people often look for the slightest weakness you show in order to put you down. </p>
